# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description the software that you wrote to demonstrate the Java language.}

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

The tools I used to develop this software are as listed:
* VSCode - IDE
* C# - Programming Language
* .NET - Framework to Compile and Build C# Programs

As explained above, the programming language I used was C# and I also used the .NET framework, which is used hand and hand with C# to be able to run and compile the programs. I only used the basic libraries of 'System' and 'System.Collections' throughout the software.

# Future Work
* Add additional modules about other C# data structures
* Make the tutorial more user interactive
* Make a menu where the user can choose which module to learn
