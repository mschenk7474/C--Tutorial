# Overview
I created a C# language tutorial that spans from learning basic syntax to learning about inheritance in object-oriented programming. I created this, not only for those learning C# for the first time but also for myself. I wanted to make sure I understood the different parts of this language thoroughly, and teaching it in a tutorial has helped me grow my understanding of C#. Throughout this project, there are examples every step of the way, so the user that is going through this tutorial can get some hands-on experience working with the language as well. My goal was to have a nice hybrid of information along with some examples that you could physically run and see the results of.

How the tutorial works is that it splits up every topic into different modules. Within those modules, there is a Program class that has all you need to run the program correctly. If you have installed all the things needed to run C#, you should be good to run each of the modules with 'dotnet run'. Within the modules, there are commented lines that teach about the topic the modules cover. The tutorial is meant to be easy, user-friendly, and fun while learning a new programming language to put in your repertoire to use whenever you may need to. The goal of this tutorial isn't to overwhelm you, but the goal is to excite you about learning C#, which will then hopefully carry over to learning new languages as well.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

The tools I used to develop this software are as listed:
* VSCode - IDE
* C# - Programming Language
* .NET - Framework to Compile and Build C# Programs

As explained above, the programming language I used was C# and I also used the .NET framework, which is used hand and hand with C# to be able to run and compile the programs. I only used the basic libraries of 'System' and 'System.Collections' throughout the software.

# Future Work
* Add additional modules about other C# data structures
* Make the tutorial more user interactive
* Make a menu where the user can choose which module to learn
